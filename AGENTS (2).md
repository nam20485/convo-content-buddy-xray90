    This file serves as the bootstrap entry point for the AI agent's instruction set.
    It defines the location of core modules, the protocol for loading remote instructions, and the single source of truth policy.

        These MCP tools can search and fetch Microsoft's latest official documentation and code samples, which may be newer or more detailed than model training data.
      </guidance>
      <guidance>
        For specific and narrowly defined questions involving native Microsoft technologies (C#, F#, ASP.NET Core, Microsoft.Extensions, NuGet, Entity Framework, and the dotnet runtime), use these tools for research.
        When writing code, prioritize using information retrieved from these tools to ensure accuracy and up-to-date practices, especially for newer features or libraries.
        Before writing any code involving Microsoft technologies, always check for relevant documentation or code samples using these tools to ensure the most current and accurate information is being used.

      <title>Sequential Thinking for Complex Problem Solving</title>
      <tools>
        <tool>sequential_thinking</tool>
      </tools>
      <guidance>
        Use sequential thinking for all requests except the most trivial, single-step requests (for example, minimal formatting changes or direct one-line lookups).
      </guidance>
      <guidance>
        The sequential_thinking tool enables structured, step-by-step problem analysis with the ability to revise, branch, and adjust reasoning paths dynamically.
        Use this tool when:
        - Breaking down complex problems into manageable steps
        - Planning and design work that may require revision
        - Analyzing situations where the full scope is unclear initially
        - Conducting analysis that might need course correction
        - Making architectural or design decisions
        - Encountering unexpected issues or errors that require systematic debugging
        - Filtering out irrelevant information while maintaining context
        - Working through tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
      </guidance>
      <guidance>
        The tool supports dynamic thinking processes by allowing you to:
        - Revise previous thoughts when new understanding emerges
        - Branch into alternative reasoning paths
        - Adjust the estimated total number of thoughts as complexity becomes apparent
        - Mark when additional thinking steps are needed beyond original estimates

      <guidance>
        Use memory for all requests except the most trivial, single-step requests, and persist relevant user/project context when it helps future task continuity.
      </guidance>
      <guidance>
        The memory MCP server provides a persistent knowledge graph for storing and retrieving context across conversations.
        Store information about:
        - User preferences, communication styles, and working patterns
        - Project-specific configurations, patterns, and conventions
        - Technical decisions, rationale, and architectural choices
        - Recurring challenges, solutions, and workarounds discovered
        - Team members, their roles, and areas of expertise
        - Tool configurations, CLI paths, authentication mechanisms
        - Build patterns, deployment strategies, and environment setups
      </guidance>
      <guidance>
        Knowledge graph concepts:
        - **Entities**: Primary nodes with a name, type (e.g., "person", "project", "tool"), and observations
        - **Relations**: Directed connections between entities in active voice (e.g., "works_at", "depends_on", "configures")
        - **Observations**: Atomic facts stored as strings attached to entities (one fact per observation)
      </guidance>
      <guidance>
        Tool usage patterns:
        - Use create_entities to establish new concepts, people, projects, or tools
        - Use create_relations to connect related entities and build context
        - Use add_observations to record facts, preferences, or discoveries about entities
        - Use search_nodes to find relevant context based on keywords across names, types, and observations
        - Use open_nodes to retrieve specific entities by name for detailed information
        - Use read_graph to get a complete view of all stored knowledge when planning or reviewing
        - Use delete operations to clean up outdated or incorrect information
      </guidance>
      <guidance>
        At the start of complex tasks, search or read relevant memory to leverage previous learnings.
        After completing significant work, update memory with new patterns, configurations, or insights discovered.

    <!-- Reference: https://docs.factory.ai/cli/user-guides/become-a-power-user#agent-readiness-—-let-your-tools-do-the-teaching -->
    <overview>
      Agent Readiness makes this project self-correcting. You must run the same verification commands that CI runs.
      If they pass locally, they pass in CI. If something is broken, you find out immediately and fix it before the task is complete.
    </overview>

    <verification_protocol>
      <description>
        For any non-trivial code change, this protocol is mandatory and must be completed before marking any task complete.
        Treat this as a hard gate, not optional guidance.
      </description>
      <non_trivial_threshold>
        Logic changes, behavior changes, refactors, dependency updates, configuration changes that affect
        runtime/build/test behavior, and any multi-file edits.
      </non_trivial_threshold>
      <steps>
        <step>Run the full verification suite (all commands in the reference table below).</step>
        <step>Fix every failure — do not skip, suppress, or work around errors.</step>
        <step>Re-run the failing check after each fix to confirm it is resolved.</step>
        <step>Repeat until all checks pass cleanly.</step>
      </steps>
      <priority>
        Prioritize fast checks. Run the build and unit tests as your standard pre-completion gate.
        Only run slow integration or end-to-end tests when explicitly required by the task.
      </priority>
    </verification_protocol>

    <verification_commands>
      <context>
        This is a .NET 10 / C# template repository.
        Replace {SolutionName} below with the actual .sln file name for the target project.
        Run all applicable commands before completing any implementation task.
      </context>

      <command id="build" name="Build (.NET Solution)">
        <description>Compiles the entire solution and surfaces all compiler errors and Roslyn analyzer diagnostics.</description>
        <run>dotnet build {SolutionName}.sln -warnaserror</run>
        <guidance>
          The -warnaserror flag promotes all Roslyn analyzer warnings to errors.
          Fix all warnings — do not suppress them unless explicitly authorized.
        </guidance>
      </command>

      <command id="static_analysis" name="Static Analysis (dotnet format)">
        <description>Enforces C# code style and formatting rules across all projects.</description>
        <run>dotnet format {SolutionName}.sln --verify-no-changes</run>
        <guidance>
          If this reports violations, run `dotnet format {SolutionName}.sln` (without --verify-no-changes)
          to auto-fix them, then re-verify.
        </guidance>
      </command>

      <command id="unit_tests" name="Unit Tests">
        <description>Runs all xUnit test projects in the solution.</description>
        <run>dotnet test {SolutionName}.sln --no-build</run>
        <guidance>
          Pass --no-build after a successful dotnet build to avoid redundant compilation.
          All tests must pass — investigate and fix any failures before proceeding.
        </guidance>
      </command>

      <command id="trunk_check" name="Polyglot Lint (Trunk)" lane="fast_readiness">
        <description>Runs all enabled Trunk linters on changed files (Markdown, YAML, shell, Dockerfiles, GitHub Actions, Python, etc.).</description>
        <run>trunk check</run>
        <guidance>
          This runs on changed files only, making it fast enough for the readiness gate.
          For auto-fix, run `trunk check --fix` or `trunk fmt`, then re-verify.
          Configuration lives in .trunk/trunk.yaml.
          Note: This does NOT replace `dotnet format` — Trunk covers non-C# files; `dotnet format` covers C# code style.
        </guidance>
      </command>

      <command id="trunk_security" name="Security Scan (Trunk)" lane="extended_validation">
        <description>Runs heavier security/supply-chain linters (trufflehog, osv-scanner, checkov, bandit) across the full repo.</description>
        <run>trunk check --all --filter=trufflehog,osv-scanner,checkov,bandit</run>
        <guidance>
          This is a slower scan — only run when explicitly required or in the extended validation CI lane.
